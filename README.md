# Browser Use - Selenium Edition

This is the Selenium version of browser-use, a library that enables AI agents to control web browsers. 

## Migration from Playwright

This repository contains a Selenium-based implementation of browser-use, migrated from the original Playwright version. 
For migration instructions, see the [Migration Guide](MIGRATION_GUIDE.md).

## Installation

With pip:

```bash
pip install browser-use
```

Install Selenium WebDrivers:

```bash
python install.py
```

## Quick Start

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from browser_use import Agent, Browser, BrowserConfig
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

# Initialize the browser with Selenium
browser_config = BrowserConfig(
    headless=False,
    browser_type="chrome"  # You can also use "firefox" or "edge"
)

browser = Browser(config=browser_config)

# Create an agent
async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        task="Compare the price of gpt-4o and DeepSeek-V3",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o"),
        browser=browser
    )
    result = await agent.run()
    print(result)
    
    # Close the browser
    await browser.close()

# Run the agent
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Key Features

- Built on Selenium WebDriver for robust browser automation
- Supports Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers
- Integrated with LangChain LLMs for powerful agent capabilities
- Rich DOM interaction and extraction capabilities
- Support for advanced browser automation scenarios

## Browser Configuration

The library provides a flexible configuration system for browsers:

```python
from browser_use import Browser, BrowserConfig

# Configure based on your needs
config = BrowserConfig(
    headless=True,  # Run in headless mode (no UI)
    browser_type="chrome",  # "chrome", "firefox", or "edge"
    extra_args=["--disable-gpu", "--window-size=1280,1100"],  # Browser arguments
    user_agent="Custom User Agent String"  # Set custom user agent
)

browser = Browser(config=config)
```

We love contributions! Feel free to open issues for bugs or feature requests. To contribute to the docs, check out the `/docs` folder.

## Local Setup

To learn more about the library, check out the [local setup üìï](https://docs.browser-use.com/development/local-setup).

## Cooperations

We are forming a commission to define best practices for UI/UX design for browser agents.
Together, we're exploring how software redesign improves the performance of AI agents and gives these companies a competitive advantage by designing their existing software to be at the forefront of the agent age.

Email [Toby](mailto:tbiddle@loop11.com?subject=I%20want%20to%20join%20the%20UI/UX%20commission%20for%20AI%20agents&body=Hi%20Toby%2C%0A%0AI%20found%20you%20in%20the%20browser-use%20GitHub%20README.%0A%0A) to apply for a seat on the committee.
