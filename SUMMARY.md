# Migration Summary: Playwright to Selenium

## Overview

We've successfully migrated the browser-use project from Playwright to Selenium. The migration retains all the core functionality while transitioning to Selenium's WebDriver-based approach.

## Key Files Changed

1. `browser_use/browser/browser.py`: Converted from Playwright's browser implementation to Selenium WebDriver
2. `browser_use/browser/context.py`: Reimplemented browser context functionality using Selenium
3. `browser_use/dom/service.py`: Updated DOM extraction to work with Selenium's DOM access methods

## New Files Added

1. `install.py`: Script to install Selenium and configure WebDrivers
2. `requirements.txt`: Updated dependencies for Selenium
3. `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`: Guide for users to migrate to the Selenium version
4. `examples/selenium_example.py`: Example demonstrating Selenium usage

## Key Changes

### Browser Module
- Replaced Playwright's browser interface with Selenium WebDriver
- Added support for multiple browser types (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Simplified browser configuration
- Implemented headless mode and other browser options

### Context Module
- Reimplemented page navigation and tab management
- Added DOM interaction methods compatible with Selenium
- Implemented screenshot functionality
- Added cookie management
- Implemented JavaScript execution

### DOM Service
- Updated DOM tree extraction to work with Selenium
- Maintained compatibility with existing DOM models
- Implemented element location strategies

## Benefits

1. **Broader Compatibility**: Selenium has wider adoption and better integration with existing systems
2. **Improved WebDriver Management**: Integrated WebDriver management for automatic driver updates
3. **Multiple Browser Support**: Added explicit support for Firefox and Edge
4. **Simplified Configuration**: Clearer browser configuration options
5. **Maintained API Compatibility**: Existing agent code continues to work

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing across different browsers and scenarios
2. **Documentation Updates**: Update website documentation to reflect Selenium changes
3. **Performance Optimization**: Further optimize DOM extraction and browser interactions
4. **Advanced Features**: Implement advanced Selenium features like browser extensions and mobile support

The migration maintains the agent-focused approach while replacing the underlying browser automation layer, providing a solid foundation for future enhancements.
